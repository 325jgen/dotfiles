# dotfiles

This repo exists only to store my dotfiles, maybe will become public when I am truly satisfied with my whole setup, when it becomes one and whole.

# Notes
* **Fonts:** A really good ui font is Source Code Pro and also, a really good font for terminal/coding is Fanastasque Sans Mono Nerd Font
