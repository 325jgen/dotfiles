### General notes about neovim
* (**C**onquer **o**f **C**ompletion)[https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim]
    - It is a very cool plugin that helps with autocompletion on many file types. To support a specific PL one should refer (here)[https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions] and install any of the desired language servers using the command `:CocInstall`
        - Note on C/C++, the **clangd** package is required to be installed.

* Theme
- Currently using the **xcodedarkhc** theme, I really like the dark gray-ish color of the background and general color pallete. I will provide some screenshots on the README of the repo.
- Airline theme is **lessnoise**. It has no colors, there are shades of white, dark and blue and just one color on each mode. It is my favourite theme currently.
