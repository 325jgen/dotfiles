# For Gnome-Based installations, if VPN connection is needed
# please download with apt (or other package manager)
# sudo apt install network-manager-*-gnome 
# where * is type of VPN connection, eg. * = pptp


# For printers -- it's generally better to add any printers
# from the IP address, which doesn't usually change
# Ok, now for drivers i will probaly have to check the net 
# every time it's needed to, but whatever.
# More specifically, for the Epson L3150 -- in Debian -- What I 
# did was to first install from apt the printer-driver-all
# and then I also installed CUPS, but I really don't like
# that interface..
