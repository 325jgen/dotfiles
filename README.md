# Notes
 **Fonts:** The terminal/editing font I use everywhere now is [MesloLGS NF](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/font.md). AFAIK, there are no ligatures, but I will probably port some from another font to this one some day 
* **Schedule Jobs:** I was looking for a way to run some tasks on specific intervals and I stumbled upon cron, more specifically [cronnie](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/cronie/). I have made a new folder, ~/.startup/ where I save all the .sh files I need for the tasks. Syntax is pretty simple, easily found on the Arch wiki. 
* **RazerGenie:** This is a musthave app for everyone who owns Razer mice/keyboards. Without this, they're pretty much stuck on default settings.
