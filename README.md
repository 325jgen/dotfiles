*This repository exists to store my configuration files, notes, recommendations, etc.*

## Notes
*  **Fonts:** The code font I use is [Caskaydia Cove NF](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
* **Schedule Jobs:** I was looking for a way to run some tasks on specific intervals and I stumbled upon cron, more specifically [cronnie](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/cronie/). I have made a new folder, ~/.startup/ where I save all the .sh files I need for the tasks. Syntax is pretty simple, easily found on the Arch wiki. 

## Gnome Configuration
* **Extensions:**
	1. [Caffeine](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/)
